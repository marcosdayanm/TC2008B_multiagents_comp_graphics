# Wolf-Sheep Predation Model

## Sheep and Wolf Predation

Here, we have two versions of the program:

Wolves and sheep roam randomly in the environment. Wolves hunt for sheep to eat. Each step costs the wolves energy, and they must eat sheep to replenish their energy. When they run out of energy, they die.  

To sustain the population: each wolf or sheep has a constant probability of reproducing at each time step.
   
In this model, we add a grass agent. Sheep need to eat grass to maintain their energy. When they run out of energy, they die as well.

Grass regrowth rate is constant.
